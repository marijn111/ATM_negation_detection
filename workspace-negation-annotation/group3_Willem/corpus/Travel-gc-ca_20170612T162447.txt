When travelling outside Canada, you may be at risk for a number of vaccine preventable illnesses. 
You should consult a health care provider or visit a travel health clinic preferably six weeks before you travel. This is an opportunity to:
review your immunization history
make sure your provincial/territorial vaccination schedule is up-to-date 
discuss any trip-related health concerns you may have
assess your needs based on where you plan to travel and what you plan to do
You may need additional vaccinations depending on your age, planned travel activities and local conditions. Preventing disease through vaccination is a lifelong process. 
Use the reference below to determine which vaccinations may be recommended or   required for your destination. 
There is currently a shortage of the yellow fever vaccine in Canada. It is important for travellers to contact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of their trip to ensure that the vaccine is available.
Some countries require proof that you have received a yellow fever vaccination before allowing you to enter the country. Consult an embassy or consulate of your destination country in Canada for up-to-date information on its entry and exit requirements before you travel abroad.
Other countries may require you to have been vaccinated for yellow fever if you have passed through an area where yellow fever may occur. 
Proof of vaccination must be documented on an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. You must carry the original certificate with you.
In Canada, the vaccination is only given at  designated yellow fever vaccination centres.
